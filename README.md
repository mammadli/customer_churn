# Airbnb Price Prediction - Data Cleaning & Modeling Pipeline

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for processing, cleaning, and modeling Airbnb listing data for price prediction. The project follows a structured approach, including dataset loading, cleaning, feature engineering, and training multiple regression models. The primary goal is to predict listing prices based on various property attributes and location features.

## Function Overview
- `jo(directory, filename)`: Joins a directory and filename.
- `load_data(base_dir)`: Loads raw datasets from the data directory.
- `delete_processed_data(base_dir)`: Deletes all files inside the processed_data directory before saving new ones.
- `load_cleaned_data(base_dir)`: Loads cleaned datasets from the processed_data directory.
- `save_cleaned_data(df, base_dir, filename_prefix)`: Saves a cleaned dataframe with a timestamped filename.


## Installation & Setup

To set up the project environment, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Data Processing Pipeline

## 1. Load Raw Data
- The script loads raw CSV files from the `data/` directory.
- If files are missing, a warning is displayed.

## 2. Data Cleaning
The cleaning pipeline includes:

- Dropping unnecessary columns.
- Handling missing values in numeric, boolean, and categorical columns.
- Processing `property type`, `room type`, and `amenities`.
- Converting price values to numeric format.
- Calculating distance to city center using the Haversine formula.
- Encoding neighborhood and amenity data.

## 3. Feature Engineering
- Extracting key features: `accommodates`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `property type`, `distance to city center`, and more.
- One-hot encoding categorical variables.
- Creating interaction terms for predictive models.

## 4. Model Training & Evaluation
- The script trains and evaluates multiple regression models.


- **Linear Regression**
- **LASSO Regression (Hyperparameter Tuned)**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor (Hyperparameter Tuned)**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBM)**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

Each model is evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and results are stored in a structured format.

## 5. Results & Performance
- RMSE values and model execution times are logged.
- The best-performing model for each dataset is identified.

## How to Run the Pipeline
Run the script in the command line:

```sh
python run_pipeline.py
```

This will:

- Load raw Airbnb listing data.
- Clean and preprocess the dataset.
- Save the cleaned dataset to `processed_data/`.
- Train multiple models and evaluate performance.
- Display RMSE and model comparison results.
